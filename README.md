Developed a Razorpay clone frontend using HTML, CSS, and Tailwind CSS as part of the learning journey. This project mirrors the user interface of Razorpay, focusing solely on the frontend components. Leveraging Tailwind CSS for styling, the clone offers a modern and responsive design, showcasing proficiency in frontend development techniques. Through this project, I gained practical experience in UI/UX design principles and frontend development best practices.
